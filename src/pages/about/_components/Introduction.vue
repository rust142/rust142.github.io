    Hey, I'm Agung Maulana started as a software engineer back in
    2023, working with Nodejs. Before that, I was a Front End of
    Developer Experience at Findig Nusantara. I'm originally from
    Indonesia and now living in Tanah Abang, Jakarta Selatan with my
    amazing wife and beautiful daughter. I love dark mode, open
    source, and side projects. When I'm not working, I like running,
    watching movies, and eating cheese.
